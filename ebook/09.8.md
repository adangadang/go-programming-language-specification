# 9.8 类型声明

A type declaration binds an identifier， the type name， to a new type that has the same underlying type as an existing type. The new type is different from the existing type.

	TypeDecl     = "type" ( TypeSpec | "(" { TypeSpec ";" } ")" ) .
	TypeSpec     = identifier Type .

	type IntArray [16]int
	
	type (
		Point struct{ x， y float64 }
		Polar Point
	)
	
	type TreeNode struct {
		left， right *TreeNode
		value *Comparable
	}
	
	type Block interface {
		BlockSize() int
		Encrypt(src， dst []byte)
		Decrypt(src， dst []byte)
	}

The declared type does not inherit any methods bound to the existing type， but the method set of an interface type or of elements of a composite type remains unchanged:

	// A Mutex is a data type with two methods， Lock and Unlock.
	type Mutex struct         { /* Mutex fields */ }
	func (m *Mutex) Lock()    { /* Lock implementation */ }
	func (m *Mutex) Unlock()  { /* Unlock implementation */ }
	
	// NewMutex has the same composition as Mutex but its method set 	is empty.
	type NewMutex Mutex
	
	// The method set of the base type of PtrMutex remains unchanged，
	// but the method set of PtrMutex is empty.
	type PtrMutex *Mutex
	
	// The method set of *PrintableMutex contains the methods
	// Lock and Unlock bound to its anonymous field Mutex.
	type PrintableMutex struct {
		Mutex
	}
	
	// MyBlock is an interface type that has the same method set as 	Block.
	type MyBlock Block

A type declaration may be used to define a different boolean， 数值， or string type and attach methods to it:

	type TimeZone int
	
	const (
		EST TimeZone = -(5 + iota)
		CST
		MST
		PST
	)
	
	func (tz TimeZone) String() string {
		return fmt.Sprintf("GMT+%dh"， tz)
	}
