Labels are declared by labeled statements and are used in the break， continue， and goto statements (§Break statements， §Continue statements， §Goto statements). It is illegal to define a label that is never used. In contrast to other identifiers， labels are not block scoped and do not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes the body of any nested function.
