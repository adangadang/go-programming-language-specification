# 9.10 短变量声明

可以使用短变量声明：

	ShortVarDecl = IdentifierList ":=" ExpressionList .

It is a shorthand for a regular variable declaration with initializer expressions but no types:

	"var" IdentifierList = ExpressionList .

	i， j := 0， 10
	f := func() int { return 7 }
	ch := make(chan int)
	r， w := os.Pipe(fd)  // os.Pipe() returns two values
	_， y， _ := coord(p)  // coord() returns three values; only interested in y coordinate

Unlike regular variable declarations， a short variable declaration may redeclare variables provided they were originally declared in the same block with the same type， and at least one of the non-blank variables is new. As a consequence， redeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.

	field1， offset := nextField(str， 0)
	field2， offset := nextField(str， offset)  // redeclares offset

Short variable declarations may appear only inside functions. In some contexts such as the initializers for if， for， or switch statements， they can be used to declare local temporary variables (§Statements).
